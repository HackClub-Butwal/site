# Public Directory

This directory contains static assets for the Hack Club Butwal website.

## Required Files

### favicon.ico
A favicon file should be placed in this directory. The favicon should use the primary color (#D22F27) of the Hack Club Butwal website.

In a real implementation, you would create a favicon.ico file using a tool like [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) or [realfavicongenerator.net](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) and place it in this directory.

### Other Static Assets
You can also place other static assets in this directory, such as:
- Images for the website
- Fonts
- Other static files

These files will be served from the root of the website. For example, a file at `public/images/logo.png` would be accessible at `/images/logo.png` in the website.
